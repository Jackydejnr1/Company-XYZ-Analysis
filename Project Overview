- Projects Requirements
Step 1 - Loading Datasets
-- Correct use of pathname pattern - glob
-- Combine all the files generated in a list and export to a CSV.

Step 2 - Data Exploration
-- Use the head() method to view first few rows of the dataset
-- Check the number of rows and columns present in the data using the shape attribute.
-- Generate the names of the columns using the columns attribute.
-- Use describe function to generate the statistical summary of the dataframe
-- Use meaningful sentences to describe findings from the data statistical summary
-- Use of correct method to check for Missing values
-- Check the information of the DataFrame using the info method.

Step 3 - Dealing with DateTime Features
-- Use to_datetime() to convert the date column to datetime
-- Check the datatype to confirm if it's in datetime
-- Accurate conversion of the time column & prints appropriate data type
-- Accurate extraction of the Day, Month, Year & Hour features
